## Testing FuncGraph

To test the `FuncGraph` module, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `graph` directory:
   ```sh
   cd graph
   ```

2. Run the Haskell test file:
   ```sh
   runhaskell func_graph_test.hs
   ```

This will execute the tests defined in `func_graph_test.hs` and print the results to the console.
